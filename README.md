Prodigy X is a cheat menu for the game [Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/).

Prior to Prodigy X, PMGH was the cheat menu for prodigy. However recently PMGH has been discontinued. Prodigy X is a new cheat menu for prodigy.

PMGH was completely open source. Prodigy X is not.
The file src/hack.tsx is obfuscated. This prevents prodigy from patching the exploit.

## How to use Prodigy X
Under the dist folder there is a [`bookmarklet.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdigyAPI/ProdigyX/master/dist/bookmarklet.txt) file.
Copy the contents of the file to your clipboard.
Now create a new bookmark in your browser. Paste the contents of the file into the url field. Name it whatever you want.

Now when ever you are on Prodigy, you can press the bookmark to open the menu.
