Prodigy X is a cheat menu for the game [Prodigy](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/).

Prior to Prodigy X, PMGH was the cheat menu for prodigy. However recently PMGH has been discontinued. Prodigy X is a new cheat menu for prodigy.

PMGH was completely open source. Prodigy X is not.
The file src/hack.tsx is obfuscated. This prevents prodigy from patching the exploit.
