# Installing Prodigy X

There are 2 different methods of installing Prodigy X.

## Bookmarklet Method (works on all browsers and devices, but requires a few extra steps)

1. Firstly you will need to copy the Prodigy X bookmarklet.
   <button class="md-button md-button--primary small-button long-transition" id="copy-button">Click here to copy it!</button>
   If the button did not work you can copy it from the following link: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdigyAPI/ProdigyX/master/bookmarklet.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdigyAPI/ProdigyX/master/bookmarklet.txt).
2. Secondly you will need to [create a new bookmark](creating-bookmarks.md).
3. Name the bookmark Prodigy X.
4. In the url of the bookmark paste the contents of bookmarklet.txt.
5. Save the bookmark

Now when you go on the Prodigy website you will be able to use Prodigy X. Just click on the Prodigy X bookmark.

It is recommended to make the bookmark bar visible.

## Extension Method (only works on Chrome)

The extension method is the easiest way to install Prodigy X.

1. Firstly you have to get on the extensions page. You can access this page by going to chrome://extensions/ in chrome.
2. Now on the extensions page you will have to enable Developer Mode. On the top right corner of the page you will see a switch. Make sure it is enabled.
